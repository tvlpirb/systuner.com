Hello, I'm Talhah Peerbhai. I'm a rising junior studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar.
Currently, I'm working as an IT assistant and learning mobile app development. I find
system administration and cyber security to be interesting and plan to specialize in 
either of these fields. Apart from my academic life, I also enjoy swimming, squash
and rally car racing. Reach out to me to find out more!
