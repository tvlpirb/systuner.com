Fall 2023 was rather interesting with the first tech entrepreneurship event 'Inhud' taking place.
We had to simulate the process of creating a startup and eventually pitched to seasoned investors!

The Inhud event is birthed by the course "Entrepreneurship for CS" (15-390) and is meant to give 
students a hands on experience with running a tech startup. We learnt a variety of concepts which 
are necessary for running a startup. This included learning how to do market research, business models,
financing etc.

As part of the project we had to come up with a tech product and had the chance to found or co-found. 
By the end of it we got to then pitch our prototype and our business plan to seasoned investors.

I had decided to co-found and our vision is to create a sports platform for our regional market, Qatar.
Qatar has been pushing for the sports industry as evident from the FIFA World Cup and sports are part 
of the 2030 national vision. As such we see it fit that Qatar should have an easy to use sports platform,
be it finding events, teammates or making bookings. The main problem we aim to solve is making it easier to 
book venues and to find teammates, essentially community building and removing some of the barriers in sporting.
We have named our startup "Sporsen" which comes from the words sport + person. This captures our overall vision 
in bringing people together in the name of sports.

The Inhud event was a perfect opportunity for this as it served as a stepping stone to make our vision a reality
and to make mistakes with less risk. While it was daunting to present this is just the start and we plan to go 
ahead with our idea.
