NOTE: This isn't some professional review, just my thoughts 

I've recently bought a Google Pixel 6 Pro and I'm honestly blown away by it. 
Previously I've rocked a OnePlus 6 and a OnePlus 8, they were great phones,
and the 8 still does beat the Pixel when it comes to gaming.

However, I'm not an avid gamer. Battery life, camera and just general software
matters more to me. This is where the Pixel really excels in. To start with, the
battery lasts me an entire day with ~5 hours screen time, despite QHD+ and 120hz
enabled.

As for the camera, without doubt this is clearly one of the top android cameras,
in 2023 it still holds up really well. The night photography is the most 
impressive thing I've seen on a phone, even compared to the S23 Ultra, Google
really has outdone itself with their AI. I'm not a good photographer but here's a couple
shots which I really liked:

Now my favourite part, the software. The PixelUI ROM is close to AOSP and its 
just much better than other android skins. The software is polished and snappy for
my needs. It's also much more consistent with Material You (I can finally say
I'm no longer jealous of iOS users :P). Not only is it consistent but its also
pretty aesthetic. It's actually a shame that other manufacturers have to ruin it.
The Pixel also has some nifty features such as being able to copy text/images 
from any app while in the app overview screen. I use this daily to copy text between
apps and makes me more productive when researching things on the go. Another cool,
feature which I use is the "Now playing" which automatically detects whats playing
around you.

Complaints, the only problem I have with this phone is it can sometimes overheat
when taking pictures and its weak for gaming. It would be nice if games had
90/120fps. This might be a dealbreaker for some.
